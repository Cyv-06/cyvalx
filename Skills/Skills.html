        <p>
          As an Information Technology student, I have developed a range of
          technical and soft skills essential for both academic and professional
          growth. One of my key strengths is <b>communication</b>—I can express
          ideas clearly and work effectively in team environments, especially
          during group projects and presentations. I also value
          <b>patience</b> and <b>adaptability</b>, which help me handle
          challenges in coding, debugging, and learning new technologies
          efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another important skill I possess is <b>problem-solving</b>. I enjoy
          analyzing technical issues, exploring solutions, and applying logic to
          find the most efficient approach. My <b>active listening</b> and
          <b>collaboration skills</b> also allow me to contribute meaningfully to
          team-based projects and understand client or user needs better.
          Lastly, I continuously work on improving my <b>confidence</b>—especially
          when presenting my ideas or defending project outcomes—since I believe
          self-assurance plays a big role in professional success.

      <!-- HOBBIES SECTION -->

        <h3 class="underline">Hobbies</h3>
        <p>
          In my free time, I enjoy activities that help me relax while still
          improving my creativity and technical knowledge. I like
          <b>playing computer games</b>, particularly strategy and team-based
          games, as they enhance my decision-making and teamwork skills. I also
          enjoy <b>video editing</b> and <b>graphic design</b>, which I started
          exploring during senior high school and now use for school projects
          and social media content.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from digital hobbies, I like <b>cooking</b> and
          <b>photography</b>—both allow me to express creativity and patience.
          Photography, in particular, helps me appreciate visual composition,
          which connects well with my interest in web and UI design.
          Occasionally, I also play <b>basketball</b> to stay active and balanced
          despite my busy schedule as a college student.

          learning. I’m passionate about <b>web development</b>,
          <b>software design</b>, and <b>IT innovations</b> that solve

          interfaces and creative multimedia projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m also interested in <b>cybersecurity</b> and
          <b>network systems</b>, as I believe data protection and online safety
          are crucial in today’s world. Aside from tech-related fields, I love
          <b>reading manhwa</b> and <b>watching tech tutorials</b> online to
          learn new skills in a fun and engaging way. These interests motivate me
          to keep exploring and improving my craft as a future IT professional.
