        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an Information Technology student, I have developed a range of technical and soft skills essential for both academic and professional growth. One of my key strengths is <b>communication</b>—I can express ideas clearly and work effectively in team environments, especially during group projects and presentations. I also value <b>patience</b> and <b>adaptability</b>, which help me handle challenges in coding, debugging, and learning new technologies efficiently.  
          <br><br>
          Another important skill I possess is <b>problem-solving</b>. I enjoy analyzing technical issues, exploring solutions, and applying logic to find the most efficient approach. My <b>active listening</b> and <b>collaboration skills</b> also allow me to contribute meaningfully to team-based projects and understand client or user needs better. Lastly, I continuously work on improving my <b>confidence</b>—especially when presenting my ideas or defending project outcomes—since I believe self-assurance plays a big role in professional success.

        <h3 class="underline">Hobbies</h3>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my free time, I enjoy activities that help me relax while still improving my creativity and technical knowledge. I like <b>playing computer games</b>, particularly strategy and team-based games, as they enhance my decision-making and teamwork skills. I also enjoy <b>video editing</b> and <b>graphic design</b>, which I started exploring during senior high school and now use for school projects and social media content.  
          <br><br>
          Aside from digital hobbies, I like <b>cooking</b> and <b>photography</b>—both allow me to express creativity and patience. Photography, in particular, helps me appreciate visual composition, which connects well with my interest in web and UI design. Occasionally, I also play <b>basketball</b> to stay active and balanced despite my busy schedule as a college student.

        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My interests revolve around technology, creativity, and continuous learning. I’m passionate about <b>web development</b>, <b>software design</b>, and <b>IT innovations</b> that solve real-world problems. I also enjoy <b>photography</b> and <b>digital arts</b>, which inspire me to build visually appealing user interfaces and creative multimedia projects.  
          <br><br>
          I’m also interested in <b>cybersecurity</b> and <b>network systems</b>, as I believe data protection and online safety are crucial in today’s world. Aside from tech-related fields, I love <b>reading manhwa</b> and <b>watching tech tutorials</b> online to learn new skills in a fun and engaging way. These interests motivate me to keep exploring and improving my craft as a future IT professional.
